 * * * * This bare-bones script was auto-generated * * * *
 * The code commented with "/ * * /" demonstrates how data is retrieved and passed to the adapter, plus other common commands. You can remove/replace it once you've got the idea
 * Complete it according to your specific use-case
 * Consult the Example scripts if you get stuck, as they provide solutions to most common scenarios
 * 
 * Main terms to understand:
 *		Model = class that contains the data associated with an item (title, content, icon etc.)
 *		Views Holder = class that contains references to your views (Text, Image, MonoBehavior, etc.)
 * 
 * Default expected UI hiererchy:
 *	  ...
 *		-Canvas
 *		  ...
 *			-MyScrollViewAdapter
 *				-Viewport
 *					-Content
 *				-Scrollbar (Optional)
 *				-ItemPrefab (Optional)
 * 
 * Note: If using Visual Studio and opening generated scripts for the first time, sometimes Intellisense (autocompletion)
 * won't work. This is a well-known bug and the solution is here: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/130597/unity-intellisense-not-working-after-creating-new-1.html (or google "unity intellisense not working new script")
